This repository contains the template for a **Thesis Guidance Committee Reports** sample. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory. A version of the template can also be found on the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/shkbwkxdpmgb) platform. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/). For more detailed information regarding this repository please follow our [wiki](https://github.com/mida-project/report_tgc_template/wiki).

## Instructions

The [`report_tgc_template`](https://github.com/mida-project/report_tgc_template) repository can be used for the Thesis Guidance Committee Reports at [Instituto Superior T√©cnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) (IST) of [PDEI](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic) (or other Doctoral Programs), as it follows the regulations published by the Scientific Council of IST. The all source of the template is available inside the `src/` folder, so please open it first. To start using, just open and modify your data as follows.

### Cover

In the `cover.tex` file insert your data (your full name, titles, supervisors names, date, degree, etc.):

	\title{}
	\subtitle{}
	\author{}
	\degree{}
	\supervisor{}
	\othersupervisor{}
	\date{}

### Chapters

The content of your report will be written in the files of the `chapters/` folder. Do not modify the `header` in all those documents, except the name of the document as it contains compilation directives. If you need to add more **Chapters**, just create new `.tex` file and add the header.

If you do not need that many **Chapters** in your report, just comment the lines in the main document:

```
document.tex
```

For example, if you do not need a *6th* **Chapter**, comment the following lines:

```
%Chapter 6
\input{chapters/chap006.tex}
% If Printing on DOUBLE SIDED pages, the second page should be white.
% Otherwise, comment the following command:
\cleardoublepage
```

### Bibliography

This file is the default bibliography database. If you are using [mendeley.com](mendeley.com) as Reference Manager, you can link the `.bib` file to your account in that swervice in order to keep the data automatically synchronized.

For those purposes, replace that file with your own file, and if the name is different, just modify the corresponding line in in the main document `document.tex` file:

```
\bibliography{bibliography/references}
```

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.
